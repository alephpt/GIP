# GIP Research Project - Strategic Framework

**Purpose**: This file contains GIP-specific principles, quality gates, and strategic guidelines for maintaining integrity across the multi-year research program.

---

## Core GIP Principles

### 1. Ontological Fidelity

**Principle**: GIP is grounded in ontological necessity, not formal convenience.

**Rules**:
- ✅ Derive structures from coherence requirements (γ: ∅ → 𝟙 from universal factorization)
- ✅ Identify categorical necessity before formalizing (balance from monoidal structure)
- ✅ Prove morphisms exist because they MUST, not because we assume them
- ❌ Never introduce morphisms/axioms for convenience without ontological justification
- ❌ Never assume correspondence between registers without proving the bridge

**Quality Gate**: Before accepting any new axiom, ask: "Is this ontologically necessary, or am I assuming what I want to prove?"

### 2. Register Coherence

**Principle**: The three-register structure is fundamental to GIP.

**Register Boundaries**:
- **Register 0 (∅, 𝟙)**: Pre-mathematical potential, ontological genesis
- **Register 1 (Gen)**: Categorical structure, monoidal operations, balance
- **Register 2 (Comp)**: Classical analysis, complex functions, zeros

**Rules**:
- ✅ Respect register boundaries - don't conflate categorical and analytic properties
- ✅ Projection F_R: Gen → Comp is the ONLY bridge between registers
- ✅ Properties in Register 1 project to properties in Register 2 via F_R
- ❌ Never directly assume Register 1 properties = Register 2 properties
- ❌ Never skip the projection functor F_R

**Quality Gate**: Before claiming "categorical X becomes analytic Y", prove the projection explicitly.

### 3. Circularity Vigilance

**Principle**: Assumptions masquerading as proofs are unacceptable.

**Types of Circularity**:
1. **Naked Circularity**: Assuming the conclusion directly (e.g., "balanced → Re(s) = 1/2")
2. **Relocated Circularity**: Moving assumption to technical axiom without proving it
3. **Hidden Circularity**: Assuming correspondence that embeds the conclusion

**Rules**:
- ✅ Decompose circular axioms into: (proven geometric fact) + (unproven bridge)
- ✅ Explicitly identify which axioms are proven vs. assumed
- ✅ Document what remains to be proven (e.g., monoidal_balance_implies_functional_equation_symmetry)
- ❌ Never claim "proof" when axioms remain unproven
- ❌ Never hide circularity behind technical terminology

**Quality Gate**: Before claiming elimination of circularity, verify the core correspondence is PROVEN, not assumed.

### 4. Honest Assessment

**Principle**: Intellectual honesty about what we've achieved vs. what we've claimed.

**Rules**:
- ✅ Distinguish: framework vs. proof, conditional vs. unconditional, proven vs. assumed
- ✅ Acknowledge when circularity is relocated rather than eliminated
- ✅ Identify precisely where mathematical difficulty lies (e.g., categorical-to-analytic bridge)
- ✅ State clearly: "This is valid IF X can be proven"
- ❌ Never overclaim achievements ("first non-circular proof" when axioms remain)
- ❌ Never confuse structural progress with mathematical completion

**Quality Gate**: Before publishing or claiming breakthrough, have external critic review for hidden assumptions.

## Epistemological Extension Guidelines

### 5. Theory as Subcategory

**Principle**: When formalizing epistemological primitives, maintain categorical rigor.

**Epistemological Primitives**:
```lean
structure Theory where
  objects : Set GenObj
  morphisms : -- constraints on morphisms
  axioms : List (Axiom this)
  coherence : -- axioms form coherent system

def Hypothesis (T : Theory) := -- conjectured morphism in T
def Axiom (T : Theory) := -- foundational morphism defining T
def Proof {H : Hypothesis T} := -- constructible composition chain
def Equation (f g : A ⟶ B) := f = g
def Solution {p : A → Prop} := {x : A // p x}
def Truth (H : Hypothesis T) := Nonempty (Proof H)
```

**Rules**:
- ✅ Theory is a subcategory of Gen with additional structure
- ✅ Hypothesis is a conjectured morphism (may or may not exist)
- ✅ Proof is a constructible path in the category (dependent type)
- ✅ Truth is coherence within a theory (existence of proof)
- ❌ Never formalize epistemological concepts outside categorical framework
- ❌ Never lose connection to GIP three-register structure

**Quality Gate**: Every epistemological primitive must have clear categorical interpretation.

### 6. Meta-Theoretic Relationships

**Principle**: Relationships between theories are projections between subcategories.

**Rules**:
- ✅ Theory projections preserve coherence structure
- ✅ Different "kinds of truth" (topological, algebraic) are projections from Gen
- ✅ Proof complexity is measured categorically (path length, composition depth)
- ❌ Never treat theories as independent - they're subcategories of Gen
- ❌ Never introduce meta-theory without grounding in GIP registers

**Quality Gate**: Before claiming theory relationship, prove it's a functor between subcategories.

## Millennium Problems Strategy

### 7. Problem-Specific Considerations

**Riemann Hypothesis** (Current):
- **Nature**: Problem within mathematics (number theory)
- **GIP Role**: Mathematical tool (categorical structure of primes/zeros)
- **Status**: Conditional proof - valid IF categorical-to-analytic bridge proven
- **Remaining Work**: Prove monoidal_balance_implies_functional_equation_symmetry

**Navier-Stokes** (Future):
- **Nature**: Problem about physical law (can Law produce unphysical state?)
- **GIP Role**: Epistemological engine (formalize "Law", "Solution", "Coherence")
- **Required Extension**: Gen.Epistemology (Theory, Law, Coherence)
- **Key Insight**: Law of Irreversibility (Gen meta-law) forbids singularities

**P vs NP** (Future):
- **Nature**: Problem about proof and computation
- **GIP Role**: Epistemological engine (formalize "Proof", "Solution", "Complexity")
- **Required Extension**: Gen.Epistemology (Proof, Complexity)
- **Key Insight**: Generative proof (finding) vs. transformative proof (verifying) have different categorical complexity

**Hodge Conjecture** (Future):
- **Nature**: Problem about mathematical truth (topological vs. algebraic)
- **GIP Role**: Epistemological engine (formalize "Theory", "Truth", "Projection")
- **Required Extension**: Gen.Epistemology (Theory, Truth as coherence)
- **Key Insight**: Different truths are projections from single Gen source

**Rules**:
- ✅ RH uses GIP as tool; others require GIP as epistemological engine
- ✅ Complete RH (validate GIP) before extending to epistemological framework
- ✅ Each problem requires specific epistemological primitives
- ❌ Never apply RH approach to NS/PvNP/Hodge - they require deeper framework
- ❌ Never extend GIP epistemologically until RH validates the foundation

**Quality Gate**: RH must be completed and validated before Phase 4 (Epistemological Extension) begins.

## Implementation Quality Gates

### 8. Code Quality Standards

**Lean Formalization**:
- ✅ All axioms explicitly declared with `axiom` keyword
- ✅ All theorems proven or contain `sorry` (never hidden axioms)
- ✅ Module structure matches register boundaries (lib/gip/, lib/monoidal/, proofs/riemann/)
- ✅ No circular imports between modules
- ❌ Never hide axioms in definitions
- ❌ Never use `sorry` without documenting what needs proof

**Documentation**:
- ✅ Honest assessment documents (FRAMEWORK_REVISED.md, HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md)
- ✅ Clear distinction: proven vs. assumed, conditional vs. unconditional
- ✅ Precise identification of gaps (e.g., "monoidal_balance_implies_functional_equation_symmetry")
- ❌ Never claim "breakthrough" without external review
- ❌ Never bury assumptions in technical language

**Quality Gate**: Before marking any phase complete, verify all axioms are documented and justified.

### 9. Research Integrity

**Publication Standards**:
- ✅ Frame RH work as "conditional proof with identified gaps"
- ✅ Acknowledge circularity relocated to technical axioms
- ✅ Identify precisely where mathematical difficulty lies
- ✅ Provide honest assessment of what's achieved vs. what's claimed
- ❌ Never submit for publication claiming "proof" with unproven axioms
- ❌ Never hide technical axioms from reviewers

**Peer Review**:
- ✅ Seek critical review before major claims
- ✅ Accept criticism as validation opportunity
- ✅ Revise claims based on substantive critique
- ❌ Never dismiss criticism without addressing it
- ❌ Never double down on overclaims when challenged

**Quality Gate**: External mathematician must review major claims before publication.

## Strategic Roadmap Principles

### 10. PDL Hierarchy

**Structure**: Repository > Roadmap (12-18mo) > Phase (6mo) > Sprint (2wk) > Steps (7)

**Roadmap Sequencing**:
1. **Roadmap 1**: Riemann Hypothesis (current, active)
2. **Roadmap 2**: GIP Epistemological Framework (after RH complete)
3. **Roadmap 3**: Navier-Stokes Application (after epistemology complete)
4. **Roadmap 4**: P vs NP Application (parallel with NS if applicable)
5. **Roadmap 5**: Hodge Conjecture Application (after NS/PvNP experience)

**Rules**:
- ✅ Complete and validate current roadmap before starting next
- ✅ Each roadmap builds on validated results of previous
- ✅ No parallel roadmaps unless truly independent
- ❌ Never start epistemological work before RH validates GIP foundation
- ❌ Never start new Millennium Problem before epistemology is complete

**Quality Gate**: Roadmap completion requires: all phases complete, all axioms proven or documented, honest assessment published.

### 11. Phase Boundaries

**Phase Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ All sprints complete
- ✅ All deliverables delivered and verified
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation complete (notepad + formal docs if applicable)
- ✅ Honest assessment of progress vs. goals
- ❌ Never mark phase complete with unresolved blockers
- ❌ Never skip phases or combine phases for speed

**Quality Gate**: Phase cannot be marked complete until all deliverables verified by external review.

## Agent Coordination for GIP

### 12. Agent Deployment Strategy

**Research Agents** (@data-analyst):
- Mathematical literature review
- Existing proof strategy analysis
- Gap identification and validation
- Cross-domain research (for NS/PvNP/Hodge)

**Development Agents** (@developer):
- Lean formalization of mathematical structures
- Theorem proving (filling `sorry` statements)
- Module implementation (lib/gip/, proofs/*)
- Integration of epistemological extensions

**QA Agents** (@qa):
- Axiom inventory and circularity detection
- Proof verification and gap identification
- Test coverage for computational validation
- External review coordination

**Rules**:
- ✅ Deploy research agents for mathematical feasibility before coding
- ✅ Deploy development agents only after research validates approach
- ✅ Deploy QA agents for continuous verification (don't wait until end)
- ❌ Never skip research phase and jump to implementation
- ❌ Never let agents claim "done" without rigorous verification

**Quality Gate**: Every major deliverable requires research → development → QA cycle.

└── scripts/                      # Build and validation scripts
```

**Documentation Rules**:

**Formal Documentation** (goes in `docs/`):
- ✅ Framework design documents → `docs/framework/`
- ✅ Proof completion reports → `docs/proofs/riemann/`
- ✅ Research findings → `docs/research/<topic>/`
- ✅ Sprint completion reports → `docs/development/sprints/phase<N>/SPRINT_<X>_<Y>_COMPLETE.md`
- ✅ Phase summaries → `docs/development/sprints/phase<N>/PHASE_<N>_COMPLETE.md`

**Working Documentation** (goes in `notepad`):
- ✅ Ongoing sprint work-in-progress notes
- ✅ QA verification reports (internal)
- ✅ Implementation strategies (during development)
- ✅ Debug logs and troubleshooting
- ✅ Meeting notes and decisions

**Sprint Documentation Standards**:

**During Sprint**: Use `mcp__notepad__*` for all work-in-progress tracking

**Sprint Complete**: Create formal doc in `docs/development/sprints/phase<N>/`:
- `SPRINT_<X>_<Y>_PLAN.md` - Sprint planning (if complex)
- `SPRINT_<X>_<Y>_COMPLETE.md` - Sprint completion report (required)
- `SPRINT_<X>_<Y>_<TOPIC>.md` - Topic-specific deep dives (optional)

**Example Sprint 3.5**:
```
docs/development/sprints/phase3/
├── SPRINT_3_5_PLAN.md              # Initial plan (optional)
├── SPRINT_3_5_COMPLETE.md          # Completion report (required at end)
└── SPRINT_3_5_AXIOM_RESEARCH.md    # Research deep-dive (if needed)
```

**Research Documentation Standards**:

**New Research Topic**: Create folder in `docs/research/<topic>/`

**Example - Overdetermination Theory**:
```
docs/research/overdetermination/
├── OVERDETERMINATION_HYPOTHESIS.md    # Mathematical hypothesis
├── AXIOM_JUSTIFICATION.md             # Axiom definition & justification
├── PROOF_ATTEMPTS.md                  # Proof strategies explored
└── LITERATURE_REVIEW.md               # Academic sources
```

**Quality Gate**: Before creating files in `docs/`, verify:
1. Is this a formal deliverable? (Yes → `docs/`, No → `notepad`)
2. Correct subdirectory? (framework/proofs/research/development)
3. Naming convention followed? (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.md)

## Conclusion

**Mission**: Maintain GIP integrity across multi-year, multi-problem research program.

**Core Commitment**: Intellectual honesty, ontological fidelity, and rigorous verification at every step.

**Long-Term Vision**:
1. Validate GIP via conditional RH proof (prove technical axioms)
2. Extend GIP to epistemological engine (formalize Theory, Proof, Truth)
3. Apply validated GIP to remaining Millennium Problems
4. Establish GIP as foundational framework for mathematical/scientific inquiry

**Guiding Principle**: Better to honestly identify gaps than to falsely claim completion.
