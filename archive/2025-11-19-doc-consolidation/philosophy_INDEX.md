# Philosophical Framework Documentation

This directory contains interpretive and philosophical frameworks exploring the deeper implications of GIP's mathematical structures.

## Contents

### Core Philosophical Concepts
- **UNIVERSE_EQUIVALENCE_SUMMARY.md** - Framework for understanding universe as computational system
- **BIDIRECTIONAL_EMERGENCE.md** - Analysis of bidirectional emergence patterns
- **COHESION_FRAMEWORK.md** - Framework for understanding cohesion in mathematical structures
- **EMERGENCE_VS_ANALYSIS.md** - Distinction between emergent and analytical properties

## Purpose

These documents explore:
1. Philosophical implications of GIP formalism
2. Interpretive frameworks for mathematical structures
3. Connections between mathematics and physical reality
4. Emergent properties vs analytical constructs

## Relationship to Core Theory

While `/docs/theory/` contains formal mathematical theory, this directory explores:
- Interpretive frameworks
- Philosophical implications
- Conceptual bridges to other domains
- Emergent understanding beyond formal proofs
